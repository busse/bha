## Background

On Friday, March 13, 2020 our children's public schools closed for two weeks due to the COVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic. That Monday, March 16 the students were all given "virtual assignments" to complete while the school administration determined next steps. Thankfully our kids (6th & 8th grade, Middle School in our county) are both assigned laptops by the school so the actual delivery and completion of these assignments was easy to facilitate.

At the same time, my wife and I began mandatory work from home, growing more thankful each day that we had jobs as friends and family started to face furloughs and layoffs.

People would as how we were doing, and our responses invariably became something like: "Thanksfully good, but..." followed by some minor venting about frustrations. Two people working from home, Zooming all the time, but most concerningly, not feeling like we were being there to help the kids with their school work and really, not giving them the structure they needed. 

As the days went on, the virtual assingments were quickly completed and Sims became the kids' main focus as near as we could tell, and waking up in the morning was at risk of becoming waking up in the afternoon. The structure that had been a part of their school day was gone.

As the first two weeks drew to a close, the county schools made the decision to close for another week, and were already to be closed the following week for Spring Break. Very shortly after, the state declared all schools closed through the end of the academic school year -- June 12th in our case. That decision seemed to catch the county off-guard. They made the decision to retroactively "end" the school year for grading purposes back to March 13th. Grades were posted on Friday, April 3rd -- right before "Spring Break" -- with a communication coming out that there would be a two week period from April 13 - April 24 where students could optionally work on "Marking Period 3 (MP3) Recovery" assignments. 

These assignments could only help, not hurt, the students' grades. We had made it clear to our kids that any subjects in which they got a final grade of A or B in they wouldn't have to do the work, but anything with a C, they would. After the grades were posted, our 8th-grader would need to do the work to attempt to bring up her English grade. We later learned that because she is taking high school credit courses, there would be additional required work starting May 6th to prepare those students for classes the following year (I guess because they really count).

As we entered the week of "Spring Break" (always to be stylized with "air quotes" given the current situation), the need for structure in their days became imperative. On Sunday April 12th at 1:05am, in a fit of insomnia before "Spring Break" ended, the idea for the Bridge House Academy was born.

I saw it not just as a way to provide the structure we so badly needed, but also as a way to provide enrichment education opportunities for the kids in areas of their respective interest, as well as opportunities to work on things they could use strengthening in.

I also saw this as an opportunity to learn how to "home school" (also stylized in "air quotes" because I know we have a long way to go to be at the level of people who truly home school).

There was a time where we considered taking remote jobs, home schooling the kids, and travelling the world full time. We didn't, largely because we weren't confident in our ability to balance work/life and the responsibility of the kids' eduction. Ironcially, now we are "home schooling" but can't travel.

## Philosophy

_"A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects." -- Robert A. Heinlein (1973)_


I've always enjoyed that Heinlein quote, not for the literal enumeration of those specific skills, but for what it sets up as the [Competent man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competent_man).

In 1973, that was definitely a literary trope, but today with our access to things like YouTube and on-demand learning platforms, it is possible to acquire the knowledge to attempt learning many skills. In the original 1am brainstorm, I made a similar list:

_Home school: hero's journey, school identity system, Landscape plot survey, Plant census and diagram, Goodreads accounts, Blogs, Agile management, Toyota quality system, Stephen Few book - design dashboards, Stock market game, Duolingo, The things we get, how do we get them? Leather - shoes, can we make shoes?_

I brought this up a level in a second brainstorm to this list of higher level concepts and areas of possible focused study:

  - Natural world
  - Environs
  - Systems thinking
  - Application of iterations to our work (experiment, syntehsize..)
  - Finance & Economy
  - Deconstruction of things we take for granted (consumer goods...)
  - Practical skills for self-reliance
  - Vocation
  - Creative expression
  - Seek valdiated truths (queston everything...)
  - If we study politics, how do we rise above partisan thinking & divisiveness?
  - Language arts & world/cultural studies
  - Fitness & nutrition - healthy habits

As outlined below, part of the Approach is regular retrospective looks at what has worked well and what we'll do, so I expect this philosophy to evolve over time.

## Approach

Since we're working from home, the approach here is one more of self-directed learning than teaching given the challenges that work meeting schedules present.  I've taking to thinking of the parents role as that of "Facilitators" and the kids as "Learners".

The day is organized into blocks, with the most important thing being the Daily Standup. At 8:30am, everyone must be at the breakfast table, dressed and ready for the day.

The Learners then share what they worked on yesterday, what they plan to work on today, and if they're blocked by anything or need help with anything. All of this is generally kept to a BHA-specific context, but we've found it's a good time to go over chores that might be assigned during the lunch block or PE if it's rainy.  It's also a good time to take check of the kids mental well-being as they start their day, and make sure we aren't just diving into work without having made sure any of their concerns have been heard.

Much of the approach is loosely borrowed from agile/scrum/lean ways of working with a focus on bringing in just the right pieces we need. So far the main concepts there seem to be: iteration, daily standups, and team norms. Weekly (sprint) "demos" and a proper backlog are being introduced as we finish "norming" in to week three.

Lastly (for the moment), this site acts as both a reference for the Learners, but also as a journal for how we reacted to these unprecedented times and tried to figure out the new normal as a family in a constructive way.

## A caveat: We're starting with a big knowledge gap

I recognize that there are many established homeschooling approaches that we are currently ignorant of. We're starting with what "feels right" and plan to educate ourselves on these approaches as we go, modifying our approach as makes sense, but also "backing in" an understandng of other approaches where it matches what we're doing.
