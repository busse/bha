_This page will be updated during Week 3 and continually as more resources are brought into the mix._

## Methods

From Agile Management, the concepts of Daily Standups, and Weekly Retropsectives. We intend to add curriculm & assginment Backlog Reviews & Prioritization going into Weeks 2-3+

### Daily Standups
Everyone must be at the kitchen table, dressed and ready for the day, having eaten or with breakfast in front of them at 8:30am for the Daily Stanup. We go around the table and with a focus on the BHA context, talk about what we did yesterday, what we're doing today, and if we're blocked or strugging with anything, and work together to identify how those blockers can be resolved.

During this time, ad-hoc adjustments to the day's schedule are made. For example, weather-driven changes to PE, lunch time chore assingments, or Journal/Reflection block writing assignments.

Also, we initiated the BHA concept and the scheduling & organization for Spring/Summer 2020 using the concept of "Forming, Norming, Storming"

### Daily Standups
Friday's Journal/Reflection assignment is used by the Learners to write about how things went during the week at BHA, what went well, what didn't; what should we keep doing, what should we consider changing. The Facilitator (Busse) spends some time over the weekend writing a longer retrospective on the week that is published for this site and is intended to take a broad look at the week both from the work that was done, and at a meta-level, how it was done, to identify changes to the BHA process, curriculum & assingments, tooling, and other activities.
