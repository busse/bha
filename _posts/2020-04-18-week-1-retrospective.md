<img src="/images/ss20w1-white-board.jpg" align="right" width="40%">Coming out of "Spring Break" we were facing the proposition of our fourth week working from home with the kids sleeping past noon and spending the rest of their time time playing The Sims. Something had to change. Thus, Bridge House Academy was born. You can read more about that (and parts of this post may make more sense) if you read the [About](/about) page, but it's long, maybe save it for the end. 

The rest of this post is a retrospective of Spring/Summer 2020 Week 1 at Bridge House Academy (BHA): What we did, what went well, what we should keep/do more of, what we should stop doing or change.

### Monday, April 13, 8:30am (Day 1)

Yesteday (Sunday) we let the kids know that today would be the start of Bridge House Academy. They were to meet at the breakfast table, dressed and ready for the day, and would receive further instructions.

A rough outline of their day ahead (and each day during the week), was written on a small whiteboard for them:

  - 8:30am - 9:00am: Daily stand-up
  - 9:00am - 10:30am Block 1 (individual)
  - 10:30am - 12:00pm Block 2 (group)
  - 12:00pm - 1:00pm: Lunch
  - 1:00pm - 2:30 pm: Block 3 (individual)
  - 2:30pm - 3:00pm: Reflection / Journaling
  - 3:00pm - 4:30pm: Block 4 (PE): Outside & Moving!

Voila! We now had the *structure* for the day that we so badly needly.

The "Day 1" block themes were very forming-focused, and were assigned as:

  - Block 1: Art - work on "identity & branding" for BHA. Individually research the crest, colors, fonts, mottos, and mascots of three Ivy League schools and put together a presentation on them. This was done as the first assginment to help instill a sense of ownership and context for BHA
  - Block 2: "Meta" - Individually brainstorm things you like to learn over the next nine weeks (45 minutes), then collaborate to compare your lists and find things you'd like to do together, or separately (45 minutes).
  - Block 3: Set up Goodreads, add books. Set up Duolingo, start lessons. Spend remaining time reading.
  - Block 4: The weather was a bust, but the house was a mess, so they did chores

### Tuesday, April 14 (Day 2)

The block cadence and structure of the day felt right, so it was time to bring some more theming into the blocks that would be somewhat consistent day over day. The evoluton of the schedule looked like this:

From Monday to Tuesday, we saw our first big iteration:

  - Because D needed to do some public school-driven "Marking Period 3 Recovery" work in English in an attempt to bring her grade up, that became her focus for Block 1.
  - Our other daughter, A, is a [kinesthetic learner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinesthetic_learning) -- she needs to keep her hands active and moving to best engage her brain for learning, so we start her day off of that.
  - Block 2: I sent them outside with measuring tapes, rope, and a copy of the blueprints for our house that showed the foundation line, but the measurements had been erased. This was the beginning of the "BHA Building Survey" project that I will document in more detail soon -- it and the projects that stem from it are a big portion of this 9 weeks
  - Block 3: 20-30 minutes of Duolingo followed by sketching ideas for the school identity.
  - Block 4: Be outside & moving! ("O & M")

### Wednesday, April 15 - Friday April 17 (Day 3 - 5)

The rest of the week evolved in a similar fashion with a few iterations to the activities in each block (see final schedule below).

We added the app MyFitnessPal into the mix, with a norm that all food be logged throughout the day (more on that in a future post).

Thursday saw the first assigned Journaling, to each write about a (not successful) attempt at resuing an injured baby loon at the neighborhood lake. This was done partly as a mental health check around the experience. Friday's Journaling assignment was to "Reflect on BHA Week 1". With their permission, a few excerpts:

A: _This week at Bridge House Academy has been amazing. I got to do a bunch of new stuff, like measure the perimeter of the house._

D: _The first week of BHA was pretty fun. Also, I kept me from being to lazy. Though some stuff does get a little boring otherwise everything is fine._ [I don't think there was enough Sims-related curriculum.]

### Changes going in to Week 2

For Week 2, the big change will be to split Block 3 in to two blocks:

  - 1:00pm - 1:30pm: Block 3 (individual, language): Duolingo
  - 1:30pm - 2:30pm: Block 4 (individual)
  - (PE is now Block 5)

Also, this website will host additional content:

  - [Curriculum](/curriculum)
  - [Schedule](/schedule)
  - [Resources](/resources)

### What we need to do more of

There are some things going in to Week 2 that I want to do more  of:

  - Get Trello going for better assignment planning & management
  - Research more online resources such as Khan Academy
  - Research recognized homeschooling approaches (since we're just winging it at the moment)

### Summary

Overall I think everyone involved would agree that Bridge House Academy Spring/Summer 2020 Week 1 was a success! The goal of bringing structure and enrichment to the kids' day while the parents work from home was accomplished. We are cautiously optimistic that we'll keep this up, and I've committed to keep documenting it on this site, in part to help hold myself accountable.
